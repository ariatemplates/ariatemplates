# This is a urlmap type of packman config
# What this means is that the main entry point is the file configured by the urlmap property
# And that the package will be composed of multi-part files and a loader with a DownloadMgr UrlMap
# The map is describes exactly which packages will be created from which source files
# This map is used by atmapreader.js to dynamically create packages in the
# packages property of this config.
# atmapwriter then slightly post-processes this map and appends it to whatever package defines the appendUrlMap property to true
# Note that it's important for "normal" (statically configured) packages below to have their own visitors, otherwise the global ones will apply

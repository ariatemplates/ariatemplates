# Aria Templates - JavaScript Framework
[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/ariatemplates/ariatemplates.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/ariatemplates/ariatemplates)

[Aria Templates](http://ariatemplates.com/) (aka AT) is an application framework written in JavaScript
for building rich and large-scaled enterprise web applications. It is being developed since 2009 by
[Amadeus](http://www.amadeus.com) for its professional products. It has been designed for web apps
that are used 8+ hours a day, and that need to display and process a high amount of data with a minimum
of bandwidth comsumption.

To play with Aria Templates, you have several options:

- you can clone our Git repository / download a ZIP from GitHub and then include `bootstrap.js` file
in your HTML page, to run the original, development source code,
- after obtaining our source code, you may run Grunt build and then include a packaged, minified
(much faster) version of the framework in your page,
- or to use the framework in your NodeJS application, issue `npm install ariatemplates` in the command line,
then call `require('ariatemplates')` from your code to load the framework.

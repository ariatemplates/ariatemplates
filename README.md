[Aria Templates](http://ariatemplates.com/) (aka AT) is an application framework written in JavaScript for building rich and large-scaled enterprise web applications. It is being developed since 2009 by [Amadeus](http://www.amadeus.com) for its professional products. It has been designed for web apps that are used 8+ hours a day, and that need to display and process an high amount of data with a minimum of bandwidth comsumption.

Disclaimer: this is an early version of the AT source code without build tools for now. Please head over to [our website](http://ariatemplates.com/download) to download a runable version of the framework instead.

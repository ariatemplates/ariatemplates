<title>Amadeus' commissioned research on European Online Travel Agencies reveals key drivers for improved profitability </title>
<description>Amadeus and Hermes Management Consulting, a world leading business consultancy, have released the results of an in-depth study entitled 'Understanding Online Travel Agencies' Cost Drivers and Ways to Optimise Business in Europe'. The aim of this study was to provide a better understanding of the operational cost structure of Online Travel Agencies (OTAs) and to identify opportunities to optimise their performance. The main conclusion was that although the European online players have improved and are closing the gap with their US counterparts, there is still room for improvement in terms of efficiency and yield of product mix.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/News-EN-CORP-EN/~4/QtoWVJIOX5s" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description>

<title>Amadeus and Premier Inn sign global distribution deal</title>
<description>Amadeus today announces a distribution deal with Premier Inn, the UK and Ireland’s biggest hotel chain, which will allow 580 of the chain's properties to be booked through Amadeus.  The deal will enable Premier Inn to continue to expand its distribution beyond the UK and Irish domestic markets, and focus on key markets including France, Spain, Italy and Germany.

The deal will also help Premier Inn to attract more business travellers to their properties, as rooms for the chain will now be accessible through over 103,000 points of sale worldwide&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/News-EN-CORP-EN/~4/Lyz6lDJD7k0" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description>

<title>Travel Agencies, Travel Management Companies, and GDSs Announce Support for Standards to Enable Shopping, Sale of Ancillary Products Across Distribution Channels
				</title>
<description>The industry's leading travel management companies, online agencies, and global distribution systems (GDSs) today announced their support for plans to implement recently developed, industry-wide technology standards which enable shopping, booking, payment, and reporting of ancillary services.  These standards will also facilitate the use of new capabilities that are being developed by the GDSs to help agencies manage the complexity of unbundled offerings, while enabling airlines to differentiate through the sale of ancillary services across all distribution channels.  Use of these common and recently launched technology standards will create the opportunity for airlines and agencies to sell ancillary services seamlessly, and corporations to optimize their business travel programs by better anticipating and tracking their full air spend&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/News-EN-CORP-EN/~4/2c0Ts4hGcEI" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description>

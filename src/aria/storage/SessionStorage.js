 * Storage class using HTML5 session storage as data storage/retrieval mechanism.<br />
 * Creating an instance of this class in a browser that doesn't support session storage will raise an error. <br />
 * Web Storage API limit the acceptable values to strings. For json objects a serializer could be passed to the class
 * constructor in order to have serialization and de-serialization of objects. <br />
 * An optional namespace string can be given to avoid collisions between different instances of session storage. <br />
 * Being stored in session storage, the information is available in all pages until the browser is closed.
